## Open Source Faction Bot

>Bot is made in C# utilizing [MCC](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client) & [Discord.Addons](https://github.com/foxbot/Discord.Addons.Interactive)

>This bot will be open source and free to use; which means, there will be a premium tier with more **features** and **commands**.
>Upon the bot joining a discord server, it'll create an ini file on a server with your custom settings and configs. 
>Everything with the bot will be configurable and easy to use. For the future, I plan to add **web-integration** instead of command based.
